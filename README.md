# Java Number Guessing Game 🎮

A classic number guessing game built as a modern, interactive command-line application using Java. This project demonstrates core Java concepts, user input handling, and the creation of an engaging console-based user experience.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🔄 Multi-Round System:** The game is designed for continuous play with multiple rounds. A new random number is generated in each round to keep the challenge fresh and exciting.

* **🏆 Dynamic Scoring Mechanism:** It's not just about winning; it's about winning efficiently! A scoring system awards points based on the number of attempts taken—fewer guesses lead to a higher score.

* **🎯 Limited Attempts:** Each round comes with a fixed number of attempts, adding a layer of strategy and urgency. You must guess the number before you run out of chances!

* **🎨 Colorful & Interactive UI:** A visually enhanced command-line interface that uses ANSI escape codes to provide color-coded feedback for prompts, success messages, and errors, making the game more intuitive and enjoyable.

* **👋 Personalized Experience:** The game starts by asking for the player's name and uses it in messages to create a more personalized and welcoming gameplay session.

* **✔️ Robust Input Validation:** The application is built to be resilient. It gracefully handles non-numeric or invalid inputs, preventing crashes and guiding the user to enter a valid number.
